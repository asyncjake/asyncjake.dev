# CORE TODO TO MVP: INDENTS NOT REQUIRED
- Head:20 image card for SEO is Nitin's
- pages/contact.jsx refactor to no form
- github links target _blank
- Home page text
- Contact needs my contact though
  - email is good enough, any techy neat way to do this?
  - where does form go D:
  - can embed google form? ew? :/
- About section similar to github readme
- Projects to reflect short summaries of current projects
  - MAKE ONE project page for a bigger breakdown
  - "the technical bits" and "the personal story"
- Articles: get this to load to a stub article
  - get ONE good article
- Github page: Ditch it
  - link to github globally in frame?
- REMINDER dont roast gitlab lol

### CSS Bounties
That damn overflow scrollbar style is rough
maybe caused by bad element spacing?
is this the same issue as the breakpoint snappage?


### Bugs I'm ignoring
images unoptimized seems dumb can we do better
components/Head.jsx needs more details, and an image i guess
console.logs in Sidebar
title meaning multiple things throughout app
env has a next config section, ideal for my stuff for now
  does env.STAGE override this section?

### Things to prioritize
ArticleCard -> CardLink? So it's like article, but repurposed for general use as projects?
CardLink directs to ${contentType}/${pageName} or smth

### Next 14 upgrade for dep safety
The same weird responsive UI bug happened in both 12 and 14, can we just upgrade?

### Home / typing subtext taglines @ HomePage()::styles.bio
