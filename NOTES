### Bugs I'm ignoring
images unoptimized seems dumb can we do better
components/Head.jsx needs more details, and an image i guess
console.logs in Sidebar
title meaning multiple things throughout app
env has a next config section, ideal for my stuff for now
  does env.STAGE override this section?

### Things to prioritize
ArticleCard -> CardLink? So it's like article, but repurposed for general use as projects?
CardLink directs to ${contentType}/${pageName} or smth

The same weird responsive UI bug happened in both 12 and 14, can we just upgrade?
