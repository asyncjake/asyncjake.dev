I'm Jake, an experienced full stack engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Boise State. I've contributed to a wide range of projects over 9+ years of professional engineering experience, ranging from React/Redux and UI design to Puppet and systems engineering for various clouds (notably on-prem and AWS).
